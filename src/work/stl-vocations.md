The STL Vocations website is currently designed and developed, and waiting for the client to provide content. This site uses ACF to build a page builder based on CSS Grid.

The current STL Vocations website is clunky and incredibly hard to use. With this new design, the site is much cleaner, simplier, mobile friendly, and user friendly.

### My Contributions:

Logo Design. Designed and Prototyped in Adobe XD. Built with Wordpress, ACF, and Sass.
