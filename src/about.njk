      I like to consider myself a professional nerd. My brain is constantly torn between creativity and logic. I love finding examples of good UI and will dev-splain how to fix bad UI to anyone within earshot.

      I am a <span class="strike">Senior Developer</span> Manager at <a href="https://wwt.com">World Wide Technology</a>, where I help design and build websites and apps. When I'm not at work, I volunteer with the live streaming at church, and I help run production at several Catholic youth conferences around the country. I live in St. Louis with my amazing wife and <span class="strike">daughter</span> two daughters. They are all too good for me, but slum it with me because I’m funny and an average cook. #girdad

      I am a diehard Blues fan, LFC fan, and recently became a St Louis City SC fan. I could spend hours talking about the merits of pizza. I believe that breakfast food is the best kind of food. I don’t drink coffee, but I love coffee shops. I like good bourbon. I have a lot of tattoos. I like building things with power tools. I've been to 49 states – here's looking at you Alaska.
